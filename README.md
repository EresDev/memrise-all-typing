# Memrise All Typing

This userscript prevents multiple choice from occuring in typing courses on Memrise, replacing it with a typing prompt.

### Installation

The easiest method is through an extension/add-on on chrome/firefox:

- Chrome: install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension
- Firefox: install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on

Then add the script using the following link: https://github.com/cooljingle/memrise-all-typing/raw/master/Memrise_All_Typing.user.js

After installing you can alter under which circumstances multiple choice gets replaced; instructions are in the script.

If you come across any issues or have a suggestion you can leave your feedback in the forum thread: http://www.memrise.com/thread/1364557/
